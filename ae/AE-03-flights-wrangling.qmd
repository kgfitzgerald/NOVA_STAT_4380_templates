```

To demonstrate data wrangling we will use a dataset of characteristics of all flights departing from New York City (JFK, LGA, EWR) in 2013. We will use the `flights` data frame that comes from the `nycflights13` package.

We first explore the data a bit. Examine the documentation as well.

```{r}
glimpse(flights)
```

# Exercises

Practice using `dplyr` verbs to perform each of the following tasks. Unless explicitly stated, you should not save the output into an object.

# `select()`

1.  Select only the departure delay and arrival delay columns. *Check: dimensions should be 336776 x 2*

```{r}

```

2.  Select all variables in `flights`, excluding departure delays. *Check: dimensions should be 336776 x 18*

```{r}

```

3.  Select just the first three variables in `flights` . *Check: dimensions should be 336776 x 3*

```{r}

```

# `arrange()`

4.  Arrange the `flights` data by descending departure delays, with large departure delays on top. *Check: top row have `dep_delay`* *of 1301*

```{r}

```

# `slice()`

5.  Select (`slice`) the first 5 rows of `flights` . *Check: dimensions should be 5 x 19.*

```{r}

```

6.  Combine `arrange` and `slice` to select the 5 flights with the longest departure delays. *Check: dimensions should be 5 x 19, 5th row should have `dep_delay`* *of 1005.*

```{r}

```

# `filter()`

7.  Select all rows where the destination airport is "LAX". *Check: dimensions should be 16174 x 19*

```{r}

```

8.  Select all rows where the destination airport is "LAX" and the arrival delay is less than 0. *Check: dimensions should be 9790 x 19*

```{r}

```

9.  Select all rows where the destination airport is "LAX", "BUR", or "LGB" AND the departure or the arrival delay is negative. *Check: dimensions should be 12492 x 19*

```{r}

```

# `mutate()`

10. `air_time` is provided in minutes. Create a new variable called `hours` that coverts `air_time` to hours. Make sure to save this new variable by overwriting the `flights` dataframe. *Check: dimensions of `flights` should now be 336776 x 20. First value of `hours`* *should be* 3.7833333.

```{r}

```

11. Create a new variable called `mph` that computes the miles traveled (`distance`) per hour. Make sure to save this variable. *Check: dimensions of `flights` should now be 336776 x 21. First value of `mph`* *should be* 370.0441

```{r}

```

12. Create a new variable called `on_time` that is `TRUE` if the flight is on time (or early) and `FALSE` if it is not. Make sure to save this variable. *Check: dimensions of `flights` should now be 336776 x 22. First value of `on_time`* should be FALSE.

```{r}

```

# `summarise()` and `group_by()`

13. Calculate the average departure delay. *Check: answer should be 12.6*

```{r}

```

14. Calculate the average departure delay for each month. *Check: dimensions should be 12 x 2*

```{r}

```

15. Count the number of on-time flights for each month. *Check: count should be 15248 in January.*

```{r}

```

16. Compute the proportion of flights that are on-time for each month. *Check: proportion should be 0.565 for January.*

```{r}

```

17. In addition to the proportion on time for each month, also find the maximum delay, median delay, and the count of flights in each month. *Check: dimensions should be 12 x 5.*

```{r}

```

18. What is the proportion on time for flights traveling to "LAX", "BUR", and "LGB"? *Check: Proportion on time for Burbank is 0.55.*

```{r}

```

# More (optional) practice

19. Create a new dataset that only contains flights that do not have a missing departure time. Include the columns `year`,`month`, `day`, `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, and `dep_delay_hours` (the departure delay in hours). Note you may need to use `mutate()` to make one or more of these variables. *Check: dimensions should be 328521 x 6.*

```{r}

```

20. For each airplane (uniquely identified by `tailnum`), use a `group_by()` paired with `summarize()` to find the sample size, mean, and standard deviation of flight distances. Then, pick off the top 5 and bottom 5 airplanes in terms of mean distance traveled per flight. *Check: dimensions should be 10 x 4. Largest mean is 173, smallest is 4983.*

```{r}

```

# Submission & Grading

At the end of class, you should submit your (zipped) .html file to the appropriate AE assignment on Blackboard. This serves as your "exit ticket" for today's class.

It is okay if you did not complete all the exercises - it is helpful for me to see your progress, and you will receive full credit (10pts) if you made a good faith effort on the assignment.

You are encouraged to complete any remaining exercises on your own, but you do not need to re-submit your assignment to Blackboard.

If you were unable to attend class, you may still submit your AE for half credit (5pts). The two lowest AE scores will be dropped at the end of the semester to accommodate occasional absences.
