We will again work with data from the `nycflights13` package.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Exercise 1

Examine the documentation for the datasets `airports`, `flights`, and `planes`. What are the dimensions of each? How are these datasets related?

> YOUR ANSWER HERE

## EXAMPLE

Suppose you wanted to make a map of the route of every flight. What variables would you need from which datasets? You need the geographic location of the airports (from `airports`) and the path of flights (i.e., which airports were involved) from `flights`.

We want to join flights to airports. Note these two datasets have no variables in common so we will have to specify the variable to join by using `by =`. Check out the documentation for more information.

```{r}
flights |> 
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
```

## Exercise 2

Which airports are in `flights` but not in `airports`? Google to find out what these airports are.

```{r}

```

> YOUR ANSWER HERE

Which airports are in `airports` but not in `flights`? What does this tell us about these airports (at least in 2013)?

```{r}

```

> YOUR ANSWER HERE

## Exercise 3

Starting with the `flights` dataset, create a new dataset `dest_delays` with the median arrival delay for each destination. *Note, this question does not require you to use joins. Make sure to add na.rm = TRUE when computing the median. Check: `dest_delays` should have dimensions 105 x 2.*

```{r}

```

## Exercise 4

Join the columns in `airports` to `dest_delays` (preserving all rows in `dest_delays` and save the new dataset into `delays_by_airport`. *Check: `delays_by_airport`* *should have dimensions 105 x 9.*

```{r}

```

Based on your answer to Exercise 2, how many rows in `delays_by_airport` do you expect to be missing latitude and longitude information?

> YOUR ANSWER HERE

## Exercise 5

***Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?*** The plane tail number is given in the `tailnum` variable in the `flights` dataset. The year the plane was manufactured is given in the `year` variable in the `planes` dataset.

Start by finding the median arrival delay for each plane and store the resulting dataset in `plane_delays`. *Check: `plane_delays`* *should have dimensions 4044 x 2*

```{r}

```

Join `plane_delays` to the `planes` data using an appropriate join and then use `mutate` to create an `age` variable. Note this data is from 2013.

```{r}

```

Finally, create an effective visualization of the data to investigate if there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays. Comment on your conclusions.

```{r}

```

## (FOR LATER) Extra mapping fun

Try re-creating the visualization below and/or exploring other ways to visualized the flights data spatially. *Note, to view the image in your html, download the "flights_map.png" file and place it in the images subfolder of your STAT_7500 folder.*

![](images/flights_map.png)

Some starter code is provided below for creating a basic US map.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(maps)
library(mapdata)

state <- map_data("state")

ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = state, 
               aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
               fill = 'lightblue', color = "white") +
  theme_void() +
  coord_fixed(1.3)
```

Adding on the flight trajectories will require some creative data wrangling. You can use a `geom_curve()` layer to create the flight curves; the above plot has `curvature = 0.2`. Note, you can use different datasets and aesthetic mappings in different `geom` layers (see `geom_polygon()` layer above).

```{r}

```


## Submission & Grading

At the end of class, you should submit your (zipped) .html file to the appropriate AE assignment on Blackboard. This serves as your "exit ticket" for today's class.

It is okay if you did not complete all the exercises - it is helpful for me to see your progress, and you will receive full credit (10pts) if you made a good faith effort on the assignment.

You are encouraged to complete any remaining exercises on your own, but you do not need to re-submit your assignment to Blackboard.

If you were unable to attend class, you may still submit your AE for half credit (5pts). The two lowest AE scores will be dropped at the end of the semester to accommodate occasional absences.
